1. Introduction

	w3mp is a pager with WWW capability. It IS a pager, but it can be
used as a text-mode WWW browser.
	w3mp is a fork of w3m, originally developed by Akinori Ito

     The features of w3m are as follows:

* When reading HTML document, you can follow links and view images
  (using external image viewer).
* It has 'internet message mode', which determines the type of document
  from header. If the Content-Type: field of the document is text/html,
  that document is displayed as HTML document.
* You can change URL description like 'http://hogege.net' in plain text
  into link to that URL.

Current problems are:

* Online manuals are poor.

w3mp is known to work on these platforms.

      Linux 2.0.*/2.2.*/2.4.*/2.6.*

2. Installation

Follow these instructions to install w3m.  

 - You need latest version of GC library (at least 6.1?).
   You can get GC library from https://www.hboehm.info/gc

   Note: if you're using GC library 6.1, you should install gc.h 
   to PREFIX/include:
	# cp gc-6.1/include/gc.h PREFIX/include

 - Run configure.
   % ./configure

 - do make
   % make

 - do make install
   # make install

MACHINE/OS specific notices:

HP-UX
	If you want to use HP C compiler, answer

		Input your favorite C-compiler.
		(Default: cc) cc -Aa -D_HPUX_SOURCE

	If you use just 'cc' without options, you can't compile w3m.
	If you are using gcc, no option is needed. 

OS/2
	You can compile w3m using emx. First you have to do
	is to compile GC library with

		cd gc
		make -f EMX_MAKEFILE

	then compile w3m. I heard that OS/2 console can't 
	display color, you had better compile w3m without
	color capability.

Windows
	To compile w3m on MS-Windows, you have to use Cygwin with
	development tools.
	Read README.cygwin for more details.
